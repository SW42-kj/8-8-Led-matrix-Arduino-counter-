## Introduction

Welcome to the 8x8 Matrix LED Counter with Push Button Control project. This repository contains the source code and documentation for creating a simple counter using an 8x8 LED matrix display that you can control with a push button. The counter increments and resets with the push of a button, making it a fun and educational project for both beginners and enthusiasts.

## Features

- Displays a counting sequence on an 8x8 LED matrix.
- Control the count using a push button.
- Increment the count by pressing the push button.
